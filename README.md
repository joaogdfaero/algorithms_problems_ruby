# Algorithms and Problems in Ruby
This repository contains algorithms and problems solved by me using Ruby.

Each file contains a description of the algorithms/problem and it's solution. Algorithms and problems are divided by their level of difficulty (level 1, 2 and etc)

**Searching Algorithms**
- [Linear Search (basic)](https://github.com/joaogdfaero/algorithms_problems_ruby/blob/main/algorithms_level_1/linear_search.rb)
- [Binary Search (easy)](https://github.com/joaogdfaero/algorithms_problems_ruby/blob/main/algorithms_level_1/binary_search.rb)

**Sorting Algorithms**
- [Bubble Sort, (easy)](https://github.com/joaogdfaero/algorithms_problems_ruby/blob/main/algorithms_level_1/bubble_sort.rb)
- [Counting Sort, (easy)](https://github.com/joaogdfaero/algorithms_problems_ruby/blob/main/algorithms_level_1/counting_sort.rb)

**Greedy Algorithms**
- [Minimum Sum, (basic)](https://github.com/joaogdfaero/algorithms_problems_ruby/blob/main/algorithms_level_1/minimum_sum.rb)
- [Maximize Array, (easy)](https://github.com/joaogdfaero/algorithms_problems_ruby/blob/main/algorithms_level_1/maximize_array.rb)
- [Minimum Product, (easy)](https://github.com/joaogdfaero/algorithms_problems_ruby/blob/main/algorithms_level_1/minimum_product.rb)
- [Find Maximum, (easy)](https://github.com/joaogdfaero/algorithms_problems_ruby/blob/main/algorithms_level_1/find_maximum.rb)

**Problems**
String
- Missing Character, (basic)
- Count, (easy)
Array
- Find Three, (easy)
- Reversal, (easy)
Date
- Find Future, (easy)
- Calculate Age, (easy)

P.S: "Others" folder contains some of the problems and algorithms solved in other languagens then Ruby.
