# Algorithms and Problems in Ruby
This repository contains algorithms and problems solved by me using Ruby :ruby:

Each file contains a description of the algorithms/problem and it's solution. Algorithms and problems are divided by their level of difficulty (level 1, 2 and etc)

**Searching Algorithms**
- Linear Search (basic)
- Binary Search (easy)

**Sorting Algorithms**
- Bubble Sort, (easy)
- Counting Sort, (easy)

**Greedy Algorithms**
- Minimum Spanning, (basic)
- Minimum Sum, (basic)
- Maximize Array, (easy)
- Minimum Product, (easy)
- Find Maximum, (easy)

P.S: "Others" folder contains some of the problems and algorithms solved in other languagens then Ruby.
