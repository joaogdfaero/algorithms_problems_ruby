# Algorithms and Problems in Ruby
This repository contains algorithms and problems solved by me using Ruby.

Each file contains a description of the algorithms/problem and it's solution. Algorithms and problems are divided by their level of difficulty (level 1, 2 and etc)

**Searching Algorithms**
- Linear Search, básico
- Binary Search, fácil

**Sorting Algorithms**
- Bubble Sort, fácil
- Counting Sort, fácil

**Greedy Algorithms**
- Minimum Spanning, básico
- Minimum Sum, básico
- Maximize Array, fácil
- Minimum Product, fácil
- Find Maximum, fácil

P.S: "Others" folder contains some of the problems and algorithms solved in other languagens then Ruby.
